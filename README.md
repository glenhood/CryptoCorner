## Purpose -
This site was created in order to introduce absolute beginners to cryptocurrency, explain how it its market works, and provide steps they can take to learn more and spark their interest. 
Some of the other cryptocurrency sites, including a few of the official crypto sites themselves, have been known to cause some confusion for the said absolute beginner trying to figure out what cryptocurrency is. As a result, those beginnerse may be left scratching their head. Unlike those other crypto sites, this site is intended to provide more answers than questions and break down cryptocurrecy concepts in a way that is extremely simple and easy to understand.
In the process of making Crypto Corner, there were some great learning moments involved. Some extremly interesting facts that were otherwise not known before surfaced during the research phase, including the high security aspect of trading via crypto. (maybe include this paragraph, maybe not?)

## Features - 
Once the web browser loads the main webpage, the user gets a brief introudiction including a summary of the top five cryptocurrecy forums, access to information about each of them, and detailed news articles on each to furhter educate and help the user make the best decision.
Once the user clicks a button from the main page, he will be redirected to 
information on that crypto platform which he clicked on. 
While some aspects of making the site were very straightforward, there was a challenge in utuilizing the main api key, which later found to have maxed out  its usage. Getting a second api key easily fixed that issue, but there was also an obstacle in executing on the group's collab behind the scenes due to a git merge conflict. Fortunately, this too was fixed by completely deleting the entire local repo as well as that local repo's respective branch, then recreating that branch and re-cloning the reopository down to the local machine.
